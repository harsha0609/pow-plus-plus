- last block should point to last main block and not checkpoint block
- empty the checkpoint's details once the new main block is added
- write/update add block logic for final block
- parallel chains to start ( for this all the main lists will be 2D lists with 10 internal lists for each chain )
- Once done, start testing with manual simulation
- start new competition and announce to miners as soon as new main block is added
- limit the transactions to be taken by the miner

all miners vs rewards and vs blocks
update axis values
show the number of miners also in the last graph
timestamp for 16 difficulty, time per block


number of hashes calculation for pow and pow++
