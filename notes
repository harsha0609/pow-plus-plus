- last block should point to last main block and not checkpoint block
- empty the checkpoint's details once the new main block is added
- write/update add block logic for final block
- parallel chains to start ( for this all the main lists will be 2D lists with 10 internal lists for each chain )
- Once done, start testing with manual simulation
- start new competition and announce to miners as soon as new main block is added
